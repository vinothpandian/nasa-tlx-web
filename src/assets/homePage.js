    The NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) is a subjective, multidimensional workload assessment tool. 
    It was developed by the Human Performance Group at NASA Ames Research Center. It is thought to 
    be one of the most validated workload measurement tools in Human Factors Psychology and Engineering.`,
    `
    The NASA-TLX rates perceived workload on six different scales: Mental Demand, Physical Demand, 
    Temporal Demand, Performance, Effort, and Frustration. According to Hart and Staveland (1988), 
    a participant should first rate the six scales according to how much they contributed to the 
    workload required for the task being studied. After the ratings, each of the six scales is 
    weighted. The weightings are achieved by answering 15 pair-wise comparisons and are designed 
    to greatly enhance the sensitivity of the overall workload score while reducing between-rater 
    variability.`,
