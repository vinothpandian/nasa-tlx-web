    `We are not only interested in assessing your performance but also the
    experiences you had during the different task conditions. Right now we are
    going to describe the technique that will be used to examine your experiences.
    In the most general sense we are examining the "workload" you
    experienced. Workload is a difficult concept to define precisely, but a simple
    one to understand generally. The factors that influence your experience of
    workload may come from the task itself, your feelings about your own performance,
    how much effort you put in, or the stress and frustration you felt.
    The workload contributed by different task elements may change as you get
    more familiar with a task, perform easier or harder versions of it, or move
    from one task to another. Physical components of workload are relatively
    easy to conceptualize and evaluate. However, the mental components of
    workload may be more difficult to measure.`,
    `
    Since workload is something that is experienced individually by each
    person, there are no effective "rulers" that can be used to estimate the workload
    of different activities. One way to find out about workload is to ask
    people to describe the feelings they experienced. Because workload may be
    caused by many different factors, we would like you to evaluate several of
    them individually rather than lumping them into a single global evaluation of
    overall workload This set of six rating scales was developed for you to use
    in evaluating your experiences during different tasks Please read the
    descriptions of the scales carefully. If you have a question about any of the
    scales in the table, please ask me about it. It is extremely important that
    they be clear to you You may keep the descriptions with you for reference
    during the experiment.`,
    `
    After performing the task, six rating scales will be displayed. You will
    evaluate the task by marking each scale at the point which matches your
    experience Each line has two endpoint descriptors that describe the scale. 
    Note that 'performance" goes from "Poor" on the left to "Good" on the
    right This order has been confusing for some people. Move the arrow to
    the right or left with the mouse until it points at the desired location. When
    you are satisfied, press either button to enter your selection. Please consider
    your responses carefully in distinguishing among the task conditions,
    Consider each scale individually. Your ratings will play an important role in
    the evaluation being conducted, thus. your active participation is essential to
    the success of this experiment, and is greatly appreciated.`,

    `Throughout this experiment the rating scales are used to assess your
    experiences in the different task conditions. Scales of this sort are extremely
    useful, but their utility suffers from the tendency people have to interpret
    them in individual ways For example, some people feel that mental or temporal
    demands are the essential aspects of workload regardless of the effort
    they expended or the performance they achieved. Others feel that if they
    performed well the workload must have been low and vice versa. Yet others
    feel that effort or feelings of frustration are the most important factors
    in workload: and so on. The results of previous studies have already found
    every conceivable pattern of values. In addition, the factors that create levels
    of workload differ depending on the task, For example, some tasks
    might be difficult because they must be completed very quickly. Others may
    seem easy or hard because of the intensity of mental or physical effort
    required. Yet others feel difficult because they cannot be performed well, no
    matter how much effort is expended.`,
    `The evaluation you are about to perform is a technique that has been
    developed by NASA to assess the relative importance of six factors in determining
    how much workload you experienced. The procedure is simple: You
    will be presented with a series of pairs of rating scale titles (for example.
    Effort vs. Mental Demands) and asked to choose which of the items was
    more important to your experience of workload in the task(s) that you just
    performed. Each pair of scale titles will appear separateTy on the screen.
    Select the Scale Title that represents the more important contributor to
    workload for the specific task(s) you performed in this experiment.`,
    `Press the left button to select the top item in the pair. and the right
    button to select the bottom item_ A pointer shows which title was
    selected. To enter that choice, press the button again, and a new pair of
    titles will appear If you change your mind. press the other button to cancel
    your first choice, and then start over.`,
    `After you have finished the entire series we will be able to use the pattern
    of your choices to create a weighted combination of the ratings from
    that task into a summary workload score Please consider your choices carefully
    and make them consistent with how you used the rating scales during
    the particular task you were asked to evaluate Don't think that there is. any
    correct pattern; we are only interested in your opinions If you have any
    questions, please ask them now Thank you for your participation.`,

      The following assessment is used to measure your subjective assessment on 
      how much workload was required of you during the task you just completed.
      `,
    `
      You will be asked first to rate six workload measures.
      `,
    `
      After you have completed the ratings, you will be asked to compare which of the two 
      workload measures played a more significant role than the other when considering the task you
      just completed. You will be asked to answer 15 of these pairings.
